# â™˜ Orobas Chess Engine
v2.1.2

Orobas is a Chess-Engine created in 2020, written entirely in Javascript.

You can try Orobas in [45.58.62.235:3665](http://45.58.62.235:3665)

## FEATURES
* Mailbox 0x88 board
* MTD(f) (slightly modified in order to obtain PV Nodes). See [https://www.chessprogramming.org/MTD(f)](https://www.chessprogramming.org/MTD(f))
* A very rich Evaluation Function mostly based on the work of Lyudmil Tsvetkov
* Quiescense Search with stand-pat pruning and delta pruning
* Piece-Square-Tables (PSQT) based on PeSTO
* Tapered Evaluation for PSQT and material
* Late move reductions (old Stockfish formula)
* Bad moves reductions
* Move count reductions
* Other reductions
* Late moves random pruning
* Mate-threath extensions
* Check extensions
* Futility pruning
* Static Null Move pruning (deactivated)
* Razoring
* Lazy evaluation
* Extended Null-Move Reductions
* Safe Mobility evaluation
* Center-control evaluation
* Pawn Shield evaluation
* Evaluation of some common patterns (rook trapped by a king, developing a bishop in front of pawn, etc.)
* Evaluation of king being attacked
* Passers evaluation
* Space gain evaluation
* Pawn structure analysis
* 32-bits Zobrist hashing
* Transposition table with always-replace scheme
* Pawn hash table
* Static evaluation hash table
* History heuristic
* Killer heuristic
* Move ordering (fail-high on the first move > 90%):
  1. Hash moves
  2. Promotions
  3. Good captures
  4. Killer moves
  5. Bad captures
  6. History moves
  7. PSQT
* Iterative Deepening
* Internal Iterative Deepening
* Orobas considers 4 phases for several evaluation terms:
  * Phase 1: Opening
  * Phase 2: Midgame
  * Phase 3: Early endgame
  * Phase 4: Late endgame

## INNOVATIONS

1. Bad moves reductions: Orobas reduces by 4 the depth of moves to squares defended by enemy pawns
2. Late moves random pruning: This pruning technique is based on the observation that in MCTS, most of the moves are not even explored. Considering, algo, that most of the nodes fail-high on the first or the second move is very safe to prune 80% of moves in non PV-Nodes randomly after the 12th move.
3. Null-Window-Factor. All evaluation values are divided by 20 in order to make the MTD(f) algorithm work faster.
4. Wide-Center-Control. For the evaluation of center control, Orobas considers a wide center (from c-file to f-file).

### To Do
* Piece lists
* Attack tables
* Fix En-Passant bugs
* Move generation by stages (hash moves / tactical moves / killer moves? / quiet moves).
* Automated tuning of parameters.
* Improve piece coordination
* Some way to reduce the odd-even effect
* Some clever and cheap way to evaluate the loss of castling rights
* Best Node Search ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_node_search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_node_search)). This a fuzzy minimax algorithm. I once tried to implement it and is indeed faster than MTD(f), but the behaviour was a little buggy.
